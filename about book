The Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas is a comprehensive resource for learning key Python libraries and tools for data science. Here are the main points about this book:
It covers 5 essential Python libraries/tools for data science12:
IPython and Jupyter
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
The full text is available for free online as Jupyter notebooks on GitHub16.
It's aimed at readers with some Python knowledge who want to learn the data science stack24. It's not a beginner Python book.
Key topics covered include134:
Data manipulation and cleaning
Data visualization
Machine learning algorithms
Working with arrays, dataframes, and matrices
It provides many code examples and practical applications.
The book is around 500-550 pages long and goes into significant depth on each topic.
It's praised for being well-written, readable, and a good reference for data science in Python.
Some reviewers note it lacks exercises/problems to practice.
While comprehensive, it focuses more on practical usage rather than theory or implementation details of the tools.
As a 2016 publication, some examples may be slightly outdated, but the core concepts remain relevant.
Overall, it's considered an excellent resource for learning Python's data science ecosystem, both as a learning text and ongoing reference. The free online availability makes it particularly accessible.
